#! INSTALLATION OF DJANGO CHANNELS
1. Install channels using `pip install channels`
2. Now add `channels` in INSTALLED_APPS

#! ASGI
3. In the asgi.py file from the project directory, type the folowing code:
"
from channels.routing import ProtocolTypeRouter
application = ProtocolTypeRouter({
    "http": get_asgi_application(),
    # Just HTTP for now. (We can add other protocols later.)
})
"
4. In settings.py, comment the following code:
"
WSGI_APPLICATION = 'DjangoChannelsWebSocketProject.wsgi.application'
"
5. In settings.py, after commenting the above code, add the following code: 
"
ASGI_APPLICATION = "myprojectname.asgi.application"
"

#! CONSUMERS
6. Now we have to create a consumers.py file in the application directory which acts same as the views.py file. It allows us to series of functions to be called along with sync and async functions.
7. The 3 functions are: websocket_connect, websocket_receive, websocket_disconnect.
